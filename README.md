Portunus is an opininated encryption engine built for Ruby on Rails 
applications. It utilizes a KEK (Key Encryption Key) & DEK (Data
Encryption Key) scheme. 

KEK keys should be stored outside the application. Portunus provides a 
few default adaptors for working with common deployment setups. While this
is more secure than having unencrypted database data, the best use of 
Portunus would connect to and do the encryption / decryption of your keys
inside of an HSM. Portunus is easily extensible to accomplish this but it's
not included due to the extensive variety of possible deployments.

Lastly, Portnus has scripts included to do automatic rotation of these keys.
It's important to rotate both master keys and data encryption keys. Scripts
are included for both of these that can be scheduled via cron. 

## Installation

You will need to add Portunus and the latest commit of the AES gem. This is
due to fixing an openssl deprecation that has not yet been added as a new
release in Ruby Gems. 

https://github.com/chicks/aes/issues/15

```ruby
gem "portunus"

gem(
  "aes", 
  git: "git@github.com:chicks/aes.git", 
  ref: "001f77806a2cbef513315993e19a8f679f8f5786"
)
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install portunus

```
rails generate portunus:install
```

### Adaptors

Portunus comes with two adaptors to access keys out of the box.
- Portunus::MasterKeys::EnvironmentAdapter
- Portunus::MasterKeys::CredentialsAdapter

If you have your key encryption keys stored in a custom HSM or other solution, 
you can write your own adaptor and register it to portunus to retrieve your 
master keys (or send the data encryption key to be encrypted)

### EnvironmentAdaptor
This is for getting keys from the environment. It is important to prefix the 
key with PORTUNUS, ie PORTUNUS_MASTER_KEY_1. 

By default, it will assume the key is enabled. You can configure which keys
are enabled in your configuration or via env var.

PORTUNUS_MASTER_KEY_1_ENABLED=false

TODO: Rotation script should find disabled keys and force rotation to a new
key 

### Credentials adaptor
This gets your master keys from your rails credential files. It does this by
looking for 

```
Rails.application.credentials.portunus[:master_key_1]
```


## Usage

#### Devise notes

If you are using devise it will by default downcase email addresses. If this
field is encrypted the downcasing performed by devise happens after the 
portunus encryption. Thus it will make the value unencrypted. 

For now you can turn this off in the devise initializer by updating 
`case_insensitive_keys`. You will then need to manage yourself prior to setting
the email. There could be a similar config option added to portunus at some
point to help assist and make it easier for developers using the gem.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can 
also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to 
experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. 
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then 
run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, 
push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file 
to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
